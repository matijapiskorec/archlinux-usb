# Slack messenger and teams communications

Slack can be installed from AUR:
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/slack-desktop.git
cd slack-desktop/
makepkg -sri
```

Now you can run Slack with `slack`.

You can sign in with your email, it will direct you to the browser to allow you to choose the team, then you can redirect back to the desktop application.

To join a team you need a join link which you can open in your browser, and the team will be added to your Slack.
