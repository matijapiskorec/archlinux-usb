# Dwarf Fortress game

Install Dwarf Fortress from the Pacman repository:
```
sudo pacman -Syu dwarffortress
```

You can run the game with `dwarffortress`.

The game will add a hidden `~/.dwarffortress` where you can customize your game. I installed tilesets and colors from Kruggsmash:

One more additional change is to set the `TRUETYPE` option in `data/init/init.txt` to `NO`, so that the font does not change when you go from fullscreen to windowed screen.
