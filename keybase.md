# Keybase communication app

You can donwload Keybase manually for your system:
<https://keybase.io/download>

But I installed it through AUR:
```
cd ~/src/
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/keybase-bin.git
cd keybase-bin
makepkg -sri
```

Now you can run `run_keybase` to run the GUI client.

You can create an account which is tied to your username and device, and authorize with the phone. Authorization of your Github account is done through posting a public Gist file through your profile, smart!
